Welcome to Farkle! To select dice, separate your inputs by commas followed by a space.
For example, to select dice #2, #4, #5, enter the following input when prompted: 2, 4, 5
Input is very sensitive to format. If formatted incorrectly, you will be reprompted
Scoring summaries are as follows:
	Six of a kind: 3000
	Five of a kind: 2000
	Four of a kind: 1500
	Double triples (Example: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2): 1500
	Three pairs: 1500
	Straight (all 6 dice): 1250
	Three 1's: 1000
	Three 6's: 600
	Three 5's: 500
	Three 4's: 400
	Three 3's: 300
	Three 2's: 200
	1: 100
	5: 50
Dice cannot be used twice. The roll 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4 will generate 1500 points for
three pairs, but not an additional 200 points for the two 1's. At the end of each roll you
will be prompted to select dice. The dice selected will count towards your score, and the
remaining dice will be re-rolled. If your current turn generates more than 300 points, you will 
have the option to bank these points. A roll generating 0 points is called a FARKLE, and
will cause you to lose all of your points gathered in that roll. The first to 10000 points is
the winner. Have fun, and good luck!"
